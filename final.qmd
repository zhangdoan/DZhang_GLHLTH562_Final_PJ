### Dataset

· European Medicines Agency (EMA)

· Collected through a library called EMA_webScrapping which scraped and published information for each drug in the EMA.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhangdoan/DZhang_GLHLTH562_Final_PJ/main/EMA_task.png)

### NDA

New Drug Application (NDA)

Before a NDA, the candidate drug need to undergo 3 clinical trails and the majority would be eliminated. Only drugs that have achieved good results in both safety and efficacy can apply a new drug authorization.

### Authorization Status

Approval Status: authorized, refused, and withdrawn

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zhangdoan/DZhang_GLHLTH562_Final_PJ/main/donut.png" width="400" height="400"/>

Classification:

brand name drug v.s. generic drug

brand name drug v.s. orphan drug v.s. accelerated assessment drug
:::

::: notes
My data come from Tidytuesday. A library called EMA_webScrapping scrapped and published information for each drug in European Medicines Agency, or EMA

I am interested in the approval status of human drug which have submitted a new drug application in the EU after 2000

I need to emphasize that before a new drug application, the candidate drug need to undergo three clinical trails and only drugs that have achieved good results in both safety and efficacy can apply a new drug approval.

the drugs in this database have all undergone new drug applications, so the percentage of the approved drug was very high. and that is different from our understanding of drug development, only a few proportion of drugs can be marketed.

Approval Status of Human Brand Name Drug, 2000-2023

</h3>

::: notes
Firstly, I categorized medicines into reference drugs and generic/biosimilar and this page shows the approval status of reference drug.

In general, the number of the authorised reference drug is showing an increasing trend. on the contrary, the number of withdrawn reference drug is show a decreasing trend.

As for the top 10 frequent indication in authorised reference drug. the types of indications were diverse, including non-communicable diseases like diabetes, CPOD, and lung cancer. And communicable diseases like HIV and Covid-19 infectious

As for this scatter plot, I also draw a diagonal line. The x-axis is the number of application, and the y-axis is the number of authorised applications. so the closer the spot is to the diagonal line, the higher authorisation rate of the drug holder have. Novartis has applied the most new reference drug, but also has the most rejection. we can also seen many well-known pharmaceutical companies here. like Merck, Pfizer and J&J.

Approval Status of Human Generic & Biosimilar Drug, 2000-2023

</h3>

::: notes
As for the generic/biosimilar drug, the number of authorised drug was fluctuating.

as for the most common indication. diabetes disappeared, the replacement was breast cancer, arthritis and lung cancer. For here, we can also see the patent protection situation for diabetes treatment drugs.

compared to reference drug, the authorization rate of generic/biosimilar drugs was much higher, with many spot on the diagonal line.

The Composition of the Approved Brand Name Drug

</h3>

::: notes
Afterwards, I further analyzed the reference drug. There were some reference drugs that have been give special title like orphan drug and accelerated assessment drug. The venn plot shows that only reference drug can be granted as orphan drug or accelerated assessment drug. and some drugs had both two different titles at the same time.

Orphan drugs will receive some subsidies and tax reductions, while the accelerated assessment drugs' appvoval time can be shorten. I have planned to analyze approval time of accelerated assessment drugs, but the database doesn't have such data.

the number of approved reference drugs and orphan drugs was increasing, but in recent years EMA looks become less willing to grant a drug accelerated assessment qualification.

Finally, I visualized the common indications, approval year and holder of orphan drugs and accelerated assessment drugs.

# [Limitation]{style="font-size: 30px;"}

::: panel-tabset
### [Authorization time]{style="font-size: 25px;"}

Without authorization time data, we cannot visualize the effect of accelerated assessment.

### [Insufficient representativeness of data]{style="font-size: 25px;"}

Drugs that have undergone marketing application cannot represent the drug development situation in EU.

Many candidate drugs failed in pre-clinical trials or clinical trails. e.g. Alzheimer's disease drug.

### [Europe?]{style="font-size: 25px;"}

Multinational pharmaceutical companies from the US, Japan, etc.

Clinical trials were not conducted in EU, clinical data were submitted to EMA via ICH (International Council for Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use)

It would be better to identify EU-based pharmaceutical companies and find out their clinical trials were conducted in the EU
