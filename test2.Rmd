## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(ggvenn)
library(tidyverse)

# 创建一个示例数据集
set1 <- c("A", "B", "C", "D")
set2 <- c("B", "C", "D", "E")
set3 <- c("C", "D", "E", "F")

# 使用venn函数创建韦恩图
venn_plot <- ggvenn(list(Set1 = set1, Set2 = set2, Set3 = set3))

venn_plot
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
